# Frontend Mentor Collection

![Frontend Mentor logo](./frontend-mentor.png)

Last year, I came across [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), an incredible platform designed to help web developers put their skills to the test through hands-on challenges. The idea is very simple: you're given a design, and your task is to code a solution from scratch, aiming to replicate the design as closely as possible. The best part is you can choose whichever technologies you want to use to complete the challenges.

This repository contains the source code for **27+ challenges** I've completed on the platform over the past few months. Each solution includes a link to a deployed version in case you want to play around with it.

Initially, I planned to complete just a few challenges to try it out and leave it at that. However, I got hooked and before I knew it, I had worked through dozens of challenges. Instead of creating a separate repository for each one, I decided to organize them all into a single collection for easier access and exploration.

Feel free to browse through the solutions in this repo and experiment with them as much as you'd like.

 I've separated the simpler challenges, which only took me a few hours to complete, from the more complex ones sitting right in the root `/` of the repository:

`/N-Challenges`: Newbie Level Challenges<br>
`/J-Challenges`: Junior Level Challenges

If you'd like to check out more about my work or explore my progress on the platform, hereâ€™s a link to my [Frontend Mentor profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Dev-MV6)
