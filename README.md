# Frontend Mentor Collection

![Frontend Mentor logo](./frontend-mentor.png)

Last year I came across [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), an amazing platform that helps developers put their skills to the test through challenges. The idea is very simple: you get a design, and your job is to code a solution from scratch, trying to get a result as close as possible to the provided design. The developer is free to choose what technologies they want to use when completing the challenge ðŸ‘Œ

In this repository, you will find the source code of my solutions to more than 27 challenges on the platform that I've completed over the past few months. Each solution has a link to a deployed version in case you want to play around with it.

I know I could have created a repo for each individual challenge, but when I signed up for the platform, I thought I would just solve a few challenges and leave it. However, I got hooked on it, and when I found myself solving so many challenges, I decided to simply keep them all together as a collection.

Here you have a quick preview of some of the solutions:

Feel free to explore all the solutions inside this repo on your own and play around with them as much as you want.

I've separated the most simple challenges that only took me a few hours to complete from the more complex ones which you can find directly in the root `/` of the repository:

`/N-Challenges`: Newbie Level Challenges<br>
`/J-Challenges`: Junior Level Challenges
