## Overview

This is a solution to the [Calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Notes

My intention with this challenge was to mimic the implementation and behavior of the iOS calculator app while remaining as loyal as possible to the challenge's original design.

**Testing calculator**

Throughout development, I wrote tests for the application using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to ensure the calculator could perform arithmetic operations with precision.
